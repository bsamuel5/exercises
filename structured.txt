Topic- Professional Tennis

I would look at the men and women's singles rankings and ask the question, 'What do the rankings tell us could happen at the 2016 French Open? Based on the rankings will there be more upsets for men or women?' One out of four of the grand slam titles have passed (Australian Open), and the next title will be the French Open. How did the top 10 men and women singles players do at the 2015 French Open and how can that help us determine what will happen in the 2016 French Open?



 What makes it useful?

The players' rankings are useful because it tells who the best players in the world are at the moment, as well as who is expected to win major tournaments. It also helps both players and views think about whom to keep on their radar. For example, the Australian Open just took place Jan. 18-31 and although Serena Williams is ranked the No.1 women's singles player in the world, she was defeated by Angelique Kerber, who was ranked 10th but moved her way up to second in the world for women's singles. 



How might it be presented?
I could list the top 10 men and the top 10 women singles players, their current & previous rankings, the number of French Open titles they have, and how far they got in the 2015 French Open. This could all be presented in one row for each player. The men would be listed first followed by the women.
